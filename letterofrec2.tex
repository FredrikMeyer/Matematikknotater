\begin{letter}{Letter of recommendation}
\opening{To whom it may concern,}

In the academic spring semester of 2015, I was Jan Henrik Wiik's supervisor in the project course MAT2000\footnote{\url{http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT2000/index-eng.html}} at the University of Oslo.

In his project, Jan Henrik had to learn about Gr√∂bner bases for ideals in the polynomial ring $\mathbb Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. He then implemented the Buchberger algorithm in \texttt{Python}, which he then used to solve zero-dimensional systems of polynomials equations.

Jan Henrik was an independent and structured student. He had no trouble working on his own, and learning the required concept and algorithms. I do recommend him for any position that he is applying.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
\end{letter}
