\section{Introduction}

In the article \cite{gaifullin_triangulation}, it is proven that there exists a triangulation of $\C \PP^2$ with $15$ vertices and other nice properties [[expand]]. The triangulation is constructed by ``glueing'' cones of $3$-spheres along a triangle.  Call this triangulation for $\S$.

A smoothing of the associated Stanley-Reisner scheme $\PP(\S)$ would have interesting properties. In particular, it would be a hyper-Kähler variety [[EXPLAIN]]

The Hilbert polynomial of $\PP(\S)$ is $(9/2) t^{4}+(15/2) t^{2}+3$. The simplicial complex $\S$ have $f$-vector $(15,90,240,270,108)$. In particular, the degree of $\PP(\S)$ is $108$.

Here are a few computations:
\begin{lemma}
The module of first-order deformations of $\PP(\S)$ is $90$-dimensional, i.e. $\dim_k T^1(\PP(\S)) = 90$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
The obstruction module have $\dim_k T^2(\PP(\K))=306$.
\end{lemma}

The link of $\mathcal S$ at one of its vertices is a particularly simple $3$-sphere, namely the join of the boundaries of two hexagons. Call this $\K$. Then $\K$ have $f$-vector $(1, 12, 48, 72, 36)$. In particular the Stanley-Reisner scheme $\PP(\K)$ have degree $36$.

Consider now $\K \ast \Delta^1$. This a cone over a ball, so it is topologically a $5$-dimensional ball. In fact, it is the join of two hexagons. So it is a $5$-dimensional ball. Consider now the polytope $P \ast P$ that is the convex hull of the columns of the matrix
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{*{12}c}
 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1& 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1& 0 & 0 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0  & -1 & -1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1  & 0 & -1 & -1 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1  & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) \]

This polytope is the join of two \emph{actual} hexagons. Thus, by standard theory, 

\section{Deformations of the 5-dimensional toric variety}

Recall that the $5$-dimensional toric variety $T$ had $2$-dimensional singularities (actually two disjoint copies of $dP_6$).

\begin{thm}
There exists a flat deformation of $\PP(\K \ast \Delta^1)$, $\mathfrak X \to S$, such that $\mathfrak X_{t_1} = T$ for some $t_1 \in S$ and such that the general fiber $\widetilde T$ have one-dimensional singularities.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 As per now, the proof is purely by computer. The technique is this: First, consider the monomial degeneration of $T$ to the Stanley-Reisner ring $A(\K \ast \Delta^1)$ (recall that $\K=D_6 \ast D_6$). Choose deformation parameters $t_i$ perturbing the equations ``in the direction of $T$'', meaning that we only choose parameters introducing terms already occuring in the equations of $T$.

Now, using the package \verb|VersalDeformations|, it is possible to produce a flat family $\mathfrak X \to S'$ with $\mathfrak X_0 = \PP(\K \ast \Delta^1)$.

The base space is a union of toric varieties of dimensions $14,13,13,12$, respectively. Call the largest one for $S$. The equations are 
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
 t_1 & t_2 & t_2 &  \cdots & t_{6} \\
 t_7 & t_8 &  t_9 & \cdots & t_{12} 
\end{vmatrix} \leq 1 \qquad 
\begin{vmatrix}
 t_{13} & t_{14} & t_{15} &  \cdots & t_{18} \\
 t_{19} & t_{20}  & t_{21} & \cdots & t_{24} 
\end{vmatrix} \leq 1 
\]
By restriction, we get the claimed family $\mathfrak X \to T$. It is cheched by setting $t_i=i$ for $i=1,\ldots,12$ and $t_i=2i$ for $i=13,\ldots,24$ that the resulting fiber have one-dimensional singularities. The reason we don't set all $t_i=1$, is that this point lies in the intersection of the components of $S$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corr}
The Stanley-Reisner scheme $\PP(\K)$ smooths to a smooth Calabi-Yau variety $X$.
\end{corr}
\begin{proof}
The scheme $\PP(\K)$ sits as a complete intersection in $\PP(\K \ast \Delta^1)$. Complete intersections deform together with the ambient variety, so $\PP(\K \ast \Delta^1)$ deforms to a general complete intersection in $\widetilde T$. Since $\widetilde T$ have curve singularities, it follows by two applications of Bertini's theorem \cite[Theorem II.8.18]{hartshorne}, that $X$ is smooth.
\end{proof}

Now what we would really like to do is to compute the Hodge numbers $h^{ij}=\dim_k H^j(X,\Omega^i_X)$ of $X$. 

We can however compute the Hodge numbers of $\widetilde T$. The hope is that there is some sort of Lefschetz theorem giving us the Hodge numbers of $X$.

\begin{thm}
  We have $h^{11}(\widetilde T)=1$ and $h^{12}(\widetilde T)=12$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Again, this is purely computational. We use long exact sequences together with sheaf cohomology computations in \verb|Macaulay2|.

Since the ideal of $\widetilde T$ is rather complicated, doing this naïvely does not work. The trick is to choose the right term order. Since we know that $\widetilde T$ has a nice degeneration, we would like to find a term order such that its initial ideal is precisely the Stanley-Reisner ideal.

The \verb|Macaulay2| package \verb|gfanInterface| provides an interface with \verb|gfan|, which is a program that can compute weight vectors given polynomials with prescribed initial terms. The weight vector is 
\[ \omega = (1, 1, 4, 7, 7, 4, 1, 1, 4, 7, 7, 4, 1, 1). \]
With this term order, giving a very small Gröbner basis (18 elements), the computations are much faster than with the standard term order. We are able to compute resolutions of all the relevant modules within a few minutes in total.

We have an exact sequence of sheaves on $\widetilde T$:
\[
0 \to \mathscr T_1 \hookrightarrow \mathcal I/\mathcal I^2 \xrightarrow{d} \Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T} \to \Omega_{\widetilde T}^1 \to 0.
\]
This sequence can be broken into two short exact sequences. The relevant one is this:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqt1}
0 \to \im d \to \Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T} \to \Omega_{\widetilde T}^1 \to 0.  
\end{equation}

We also have the restriced Euler sequence:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqeuler}
0 \to \Omega_{\PP^{13}} \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T} \to \OO_{\widetilde T}(-1)^{14} \to \OO_{\widetilde   T} \to 0.
\end{equation}

We first compute $h^{11}$. From \eqref{eqt1}  we get a long exact sequence
\[
\ldots \to H^1(\im d) \to H^1(\Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T}) \to H^1(\Omega_{\widetilde T}^1) \to H^2(\im d) \to \ldots 
\]
The cohomology of $H^1(\im d)$ and $H^2(\im d)$ was computed with \verb|Macaulay2| to be both zero. Thus $H^1(\Omega_{\widetilde T}^1) \simeq H^1(\Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T})$. From the Euler sequence we get 
\[
\ldots \to H^0(\OO_{\widetilde T}(-1)^{14}) \to H^0(\OO_{\widetilde T}) \to H^1(\Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T}) \to H^1(\OO_{\widetilde T}(-1)^{14}) \to \ldots
\]
But the left and right terms are both zero. Hence $h^{11}=1$. We now compute $h^{12}$. 

From \eqref{eqt1} we again get 
\[
0 \to H^2(\Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T}) \to H^2(\Omega_{\widetilde T}^1) \to H^3(\im d) \to H^3(\Omega_{\PP^{13}}^1 \otimes \OO_{\widetilde T}) \to \ldots ,
\]
where we have used that $H^2(\im d)=0$. But from the Euler sequence we get that the right term is also zero. Thus $H^2(\Omega_{\widetilde T}^1) \simeq H^3(\im d)$. This last group can be computed in \verb|Macaulay2| to be $12$-dimensional. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
 The reader may wonder we just didn't ask \verb|Macaulay2| to compute the cohomology sheaf $\Omega_{\widetilde T}^1$ directly, e.g. by the command \verb|HH^i(cotangentSheaf Proj A)|. The reason is that \verb|Macaulay2|'s algorithims actually compute the \emph{sheaf}, and not just the dimension, and this is too computationally intensive.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Question]
A computation revelas that $H^i(\mathcal I/\mathcal I^2) \simeq H^i(\im d)$ for $ i\geq 2$. This could be because the singularities are of dimension $1$. Is there a theoretical result to this effect?
\end{remark}

We can compute it \verb|Macaulay2| that:
\begin{lemma}
The first cotangent module of $\widetilde T$ has $\dim_k T^1(\widetilde T/k) = 26$. 
\end{lemma}

We have that $h^0(\PP(\K \ast \Delta^1),\mathcal T)=14$ by Theorem 5.2 in \cite{deforming_christophersen}. Thus these numbers fit in the narrative that we should have $T^1_{X_0} = h^1(\mathcal T_{X_t}) + h^0(\mathcal T_{X_0})$. (IS THERE ANY HEURISTIC FOR THIS??)
