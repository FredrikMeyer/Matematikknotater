We work over $\C$. 

\section{Stanley-Reisner basics}

Given a simplicial complex $\K$, one can associate to it a projective scheme $\PP(\K)$ defined as follows. Let $P$ be the polynomial ring with one variable for each vertex of $\K$. Then the \emph{Stanley-Reisner ideal $I_\K$} corresponding to $\K$ is generated by the monomials corresponding to \emph{non-faces} of $\K$. Then we define the \emph{Stanley-Reisner scheme} to be $\Proj P/I_\K$. 

\begin{example}
Let $\K$ be the square, with vertices $v_0,v_1,v_2,v_3$. Then the Stanley-Reisner ideal is generated by $v_0v_2$ and $v_1v_3$.
\end{example}

Some of the topology of the simplicial complex is encoded in the scheme structure of $\PP(\K)$. In particular, the simplicial (co)homology groups of $\K$ can be computed as the sheaf cohomology of $\PP(\K)$

\begin{lemma}
Let $(K;\C)$ denote the singular cohomology groups of $\K$. Then there are isomorphisms $H^i(K;\C)=H^i(\PP(\K),\OO_{\PP(\K)})$ for all $i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
---------to come-----------
\end{proof}

\begin{corr}
We have isomorphisms $H^i(K,\C) \simeq H^{2i}(\PP(\K);\C)$ of singular cohomology groups.
\end{corr}
\begin{proof}
Something about $i$-cells in even dimensions
\end{proof}

\section{Calabi-Yau basics}

\begin{defi}
A \emph{Calabi-Yau variety} is a smooth projective variety satisfying the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $H^i(X,\OO_X)=0$ for $0 < i < \dim X$.
	\item The canonical sheaf is trivial: $\omega_X \simeq \OO_X$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

The classical example of a Calabi-Yau manifold is the quintic threefold in $\PP^5$. Another example is the following:

\begin{example}
Let $X$ be the double cover of $\PP^3$ ramified along a smooth octic. The projection map is affine, so the conditions on $H^i(X,\OO_X)$ are fulfilled. To see that the canonical sheaf is trivial, we use the adjunction formula, which says that $K_X= 2 \restr{K_{\PP^3}}{X}Â + \deg R$, where $R$ is the ramification divisor. Then, since $\omega_{\PP^3}=\OO_{\PP^3}(-4)$, it follows that $K_X=0$.
\end{example}

If $\K$ is a simplicial sphere, then a smoothing of $\PP(\K)$ will give a Calabi-Yau manifold.

\chapter{Two topologically distinct smoothings}

Denote by $dP_6$ the del Pezzo surface of degree 6 embedded in $\PP^6$. This can be realized as the blow-up of $\PP^2$ in three points not lying on a line. Let $X$ denote the affine cone over $dP_6$. Then it has long been known that $X$ has two smoothing components, and we show here that they are topologically distinct.

Recall that a \emph{del Pezzo} surface is a surface such that the anti-canonical bundle is ample. The degree is the degree given by the anticanonical embedding. It is a classical result that every del Pezzo surface is obtained either by blowing up $\PP^2$ in $r=0,\ldots,6$ points in suitable positions, or as the $2$-uple embedding of a quadric surface in $\PP^3$. 

\section{Different embeddings of $dP_6$}

We first obtain the equations of $dP_6$ directly from the description of it as blow-up. Let $x_0,x_1,x_2$ be coordinates of $\PP^2$. Recall that the blowup of $\PP^2$ in the point $(1:0:0)$ can be realized as the closed subscheme of $\PP^2 \times \PP^1$ given by the equation $r_0x_1-r_1x_2=0$, where $r_0,r_1$ are coordinates on $\PP^1$. We can repeat this process on the points $(0:1:0)$ and $(0:0:1)$ to obtain similar equations. Collecting these, we see that $dP_6$ is given by the matrix equation
\[
M\vec x = 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & r_0 & -r_1 \\
s_1 & 0 & -s_0 \\
-t_0 & t_1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0
\end{pmatrix}= 0.
\]
in $\PP^2 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$. Here $r_i,s_i$ and $t_i$ ($i=0,1$) are of course coordinates on $\PP^1$.

We can do more than this however. 

\begin{lemma}
We can also realize $dP_6$ embedded in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ with equation $r_0s_0t_0=r_1s_1t_1$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Note that the matrix cannot have rank $1$ or lower.

Now consider the projection onto the last three factors:
$$
\pi:\PP^2 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1 \to \PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1.
$$
Each point $P$ in the product on the right-hand side gives a matrix $M_P$ of rank $2$. Thus there is a line of solutions, which correspond exactly to a point in $\PP^2$.

Hence the restriction of $\pi$ to $dP_6$ is an isomorphism onto the hypersurface given by $\det M=0$ in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$. 
\end{proof}

Another way to realize blow-ups is this: let $\mathfrak d$ be the linear system of quadrics with assigned basepoints $(1:0:0)$, $(0:1:0)$ and $(0:0:1)$ in $\PP^2$. We can choose a basis given by $x_0x_1,x_0x_2$ and $x_1x_2$. This gives a rational map $\PP^2 \rmap \PP^2$. The closure of the graph of this map is a subvariety of $\PP^2 \times \PP^2$ defined by two bilinear equations. Each of the projections correspond to the blowup.

Explicitly, if we let $y_0,y_1,y_2$ be coordinates on the other $\PP^2$, then the equations are $x_1y_0-x_1y_1=x_1y_1-x_2y_2=0$.

We also have a natural embedding in $\PP^6$ as follows. Denote by $E_1, E_2, E_3$ the exceptional divisors on the blowup. Let $L$ be a line in $\PP^2$. Then the divisor $\pi^\ast 3L - E_1-E_2-E_3$ is ample, and gives an embedding in $\PP^6$ (see \cite[Chapter V, Theorem 4.6]{hartshorne}). A basis for the corresponding linear system is given by all monomials in $\Gamma(\PP^2,\OO_{\PP^2}(3))$ except $x^3,y^3$ and $z^3$. 

The equations can be arranged in a particularly symmetric form: let $y,x_1,\ldots,x_1$ be coordinates on $\PP^6$. Then the equations of $dP_6$ are the $2 \times 2$ minors of the matrix
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 & y & x_6 \\
x_2 & x_3 & y \\
y & x_4 & x_5
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
This gives $9$ equations, which can be compactly written as $x_ix_{i+2}-yx_i=0$ and $x_ix_{i+3}-y^2=0$, for $i=1,\ldots,6$ (where $i$ is taken modulo $6$). Note that the equations have a visible $D_6$-symmetry, where $D_6$ denotes the dihedral group.

\subsection{As a toric variety}

There is a nice combinatorial description of $dP_6$ as a toric variety associated to a polytope. Namely, let $P$ denote the hexagon in \figref{hexagon}. Then the normal fan of this polytope defines a fan in $N_\R$, defining a toric variety.

\label{fig:fandp6}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Toric description of $dP_6$.}
\end{figure}

The polytope is reflexive, implying that the normal fan of $P$ is the face fan over the same polytope. See \figref{fandp6}. From standard toric geometry, it is clear that $dP_6$ is the blowup of $\PP^2$ in the three torus-fixed points.

\section{The affine cone and its two smoothings}

Let $X$ denote the affine cone over $dP_6$. It is an affine variety with an isolated singularity at the origin. One can compute that it has two smoothing components: the union of a plane and a line. They both come from different ways of perturbing the equations of $dP_6$.

\end{figure}

Look at \figref{dp6p1}. One can read off the equations of $dP_6$ by taking minors along ``faces'' and long diagonals of this square. This correspond to a hyperplane cut of $\PP^ 1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ in the Segre embedding. Then the one-dimensional component of the versal deformation of $X$ is obtained by perturbing one of the $y_0$-corners as in \figref{dp6p12}.

It is clear the corresponding deformation is smooth, since it is a hyperplane cut of cone over $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ outside the origin. Call this smoothing $X_1$.

\begin{lemma}
The smoothing $X_1$ is isomorphic to $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1 \bs dP_6$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Specialize to some $t \neq 0$. Then we can homogenize the equations with respect to $y_1$ to obtain a projective variety in $8$ variables. However, in this form, $y_0-ty_1$ and $y_0$ are linearly independent, hence by a change of variables, we see that this variety is in fact isomorphic to $\PP^1 \times \PP^1 \times \PP^1$ in its Segre embedding.

What we gained by homogenizing is exactly the projective variety given by setting $y_1=0$. But then we get back the equations of $dP_6$ in $\PP^6$.
\end{proof}

The second smoothing is obtained by deforming the equations of $dP_6$ as a subvariety of $\PP^2 \times \PP^2$. Namely, consider the following matrix:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:def2}
\begin{vmatrix}
x_1 & y_0 & x_6 \\
x_2 & x_3 & y_0-t_1 \\
y_0-t_2 & x_4 & x_5
\end{vmatrix} \leq 1.
\end{equation}


For $t_1=t_2=0$, we get the cone over $dP_6$, while for generic $t_i$, we get a smooth variety. In fact, we can compute that the discrimant locus (the set of points in $\Aa^2_{t_1,t_2}$ with singular fiber) are the $t_1$-axis, the $t_2$-axis and the line $t_1=t_2$. 

Call (any) smooth fiber $X_2$. 

\begin{lemma}
The variety $X_2$ is isomorphic to $(\PP^2 \times \PP^2) \cap H \bs dP_6$, where $H$ is a hyperplane in $\PP^8$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The technique is the same as in the previous proof. First homogenize the equations \eqref{eq:def2} with respect to $y_1$. If we let $t_{ij}$ ($i,j=0,1,2$) be coordinates of $\PP^8$, then the homogenized variety is $\PP^2 \times \PP^2 \cap \{h = 0\}$, where $h$ is the hyperplane $(t(t_{32}-t_{11})=s(t_{23}-t_{11}$.

Again, what we gained by homogenizing is given by intersecting with $y_1=0$. But this is exactly $dP_6$ again, in the form $\PP^2 \times \PP^2 \cap \{ t_{23}=t_{32}=0 \}$. 
\end{proof}

We can use what we know about the topology of these spaces to compute homology groups of the two affine smoothings.

\begin{thm}
The two affine smoothings are topologically different. The homology groups are:

\begin{tabular}{ l || c | c | c | c | c | c | c || c }
 Group & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & Euler-characteristic \\
\hline
$H^i(X_1,\Z)$ & 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
$H^i(X_2,\Z)$ & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0  & 0
\end{tabular}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Long exact sequence of a pair + Lefschetz duality 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
In fact, the Andreotti-Frankel theorem \cite{andreotti_affinecw} states the following: if $V$ is any smooth affine variety of complex dimension $n$, then it has the homotopy type of a CW complex of dimension $n$.
\end{remark}

\chapter{A smooth Calabi-Yau}

Consider the hexagon $E_6$. The join $E_6 \ast E_6$ is a $3$-dimensional sphere, and so a smoothing of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner scheme would correspond to a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold. In this chapter I prove that there does indeed exist a smoothing, and I describe some of its properties.

Description, singularities, etc.
