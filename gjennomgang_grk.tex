\begin{exc}[Eksamen 2008, 1]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find three different abelian groups of order $8$. Explain why all abelian groups of order $8$ are isomorphic to one of these.
	\item Find a non-abelian group of order $8$.
	\item How many subgroups of order $8$ does $S_4$ have? How many of these are abelian?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item All finite abelian groups are products of cyclic groups. If the order of the group is $8$, then the order of each factor must be $2$. Hence there are three possibilities: $\Z_8, \Z_2 \times \Z_4$ or $\Z_2 \times \Z_2 \times \Z_2$, and these are all of them.

	Note that we used the theorem about finitely generated abelian groups in the first sentence.
	\item Let $D_4$ be the group of symmetries of the square. It is generated by a rotation of order $4$, together with a reflection through one of the diagonals. Explicitly, call these two generators for $\rho$ and $\sigma$. They satisify the three relations $\rho^4=e$, $\sigma^2=e$, and $\sigma \rho \sigma = \rho^{-1}$. The last one implies that the $\rho \sigma \neq \sigma \rho$, hence the groups is not abelian.

	To see this more explicitly, make a paper square, and mark its corners with the letters $A-D$ on both sides of the paper. Then ``compute'' what the results of $\rho \sigma$ and $\sigma \rho$ are.
	\item $S_4$ is the symmetric group on $4$ letters, hence it has order $24$. A subgroup of order $8$ is a Sylow $2$-subgroup. 

	By the Sylow theorem, the number of Sylow $2$-subgroups $n_p$ is divisible by $3$ and satisfies $n_p \equiv 1 \pmod 2$. Hence there are either $1$ or $3$ such subgroups.

	I claim that there cannot be just $1$. Here's why. Note that $D_4 \subset S_4$ as a subgroup. It is generated by the permutation $\rho=(1234)$ and $\sigma=(24)$. I claim that $D_4$ is \emph{not} a normal subgroup of $S_4$.

	Namely, let $\gamma$ be the permutation $(14)$. Then compute $\gamma^{-1}\rho \gamma$. It turns out to be equal to $(1423)$, which is not in $D_4$ (it is not a symmetry of the square!). Hence $D_4$ is not a normal subgroup of $S_4$, but it is a Sylow $2$-subgroup. Since it is not normal, there must be $3$ such groups.

	Note that all conjugate groups are isomorphic, hence there are abelian subgroups of order $8$.

\begin{exc}[Eksamen 2008, 3]
Let $f(x)= x^4-2x^2-3$. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find the splitting field $E$ of $f(x)$ over $\Q$. What is $[E:\Q]$ and $\Gal(E/\Q)$?
	\item Find an element $\alpha \in E$ such that $E=\Q(\alpha)$. What is its minimal polynomial over $\Q$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The splitting field of a polynomial is the smallest extension of $\Q$ that contains all the roots of $f(x)$. By putting $u=x^2$, we can use the abc-formula to find the roots. One fins that $f(x)=(x^2+1)(x^2-3)$. Hence the roots of $f(x)$ are $\pm i$ and $\pm \sqrt{3}$. Then clearly the splitting field must contain $\Q(i)$ and $\Q(\sqrt 3)$. The smallest field containing both is $\Q(i, \sqrt 3)$, which then must be the splitting field of $f(x)$. 

	Note that we have $[E:\Q)]=[\Q(\sqrt 3)(i):\Q(\sqrt 3)][\Q(\sqrt 3):\Q]$. The second factor is $2$, and since $i \not \in \Q(\sqrt 3)$, the first factor is $2$ as well. Hence the extension is of degree $4$.

	To find the Galois group, one looks at how the roots of $f(x)$ can be permuted. There are only two groups of order $4$. Either they are $\Z_4$ or $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$. The Galois groups is generated by the permutations of $E/\Q$ sending $\sqrt 3$ and $i$ to its conjugates. These two permutations are independent (they commute), hence the group must be $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$.
	\item By an educated guess, let $\alpha=\sqrt 3 + i$. Then clearly $\alpha \in E$. We have:
	\begin{align*}
	\alpha^2 &= 3 + 2 i \sqrt 3  -1 = 2 + 2i  \sqrt 3 \\
	&\Rightarrow  (\alpha^2-2)^2 = -4.
	\end{align*}
	Multiplying out gives $\alpha^4-4\alpha^2-12=0$. Let $g(x)=x^4-4x^2-12$ is an irreducible polynomial over $\Q$, having $\alpha$ as root. This gives a splitting field of degree $4$, but since $\alpha \in E$, we must have $E= \Q(\alpha)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{sol}

\begin{exc}[Eksamen 2010, 3]
Let $f(x)=x^3-3$ and $g(x)=x^4-2x^2-3$ be polynomials in $\Q[x]$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\Q$ and that $g(x)$ is reducible.
	\item Find the splitting field of $g(x)$. Compute $[E:\Q]$ and find the Galois group. 
	\item Find the splitting field $K$ of the family $\{ f(x), g(x) \} $. Show that $[K:\Q]=12$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item That $f(x)$ is irreducible follows for example by Eisenstein's criterium by setting $p=3$. The other polynomial was computed with in the previous exercise.
	\item See the above.
	\item $K$ is the smallest field containing all the roots of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Hence it is equal to $\Q(i,\sqrt 3, \sqrt[3]{3}e^{2 \pi i/3})$.

	Let $\zeta = e^{2 \pi i/3}$. This is a solution of $z^3-1=0$, but this polynomial is reducible. The minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ is $x^2+x+1$, which have solutions $(-1 \pm \sqrt{-3})/2$. But these elements are already in $E$ (since $\sqrt 3$ and $\sqrt {-1}$ are)! Hence
	$$
	K = \Q(i, \sqrt 3, \sqrt[3]{3}e^{2\pi i/3}) = \Q(i, \sqrt 3, \sqrt[3]{3}).
	$$
	This extension clearly has degree $12$, since it is generated by three independent elements of degree $2,2$ and $3$.
\end{enumerate}
