\section{Lecture 1}

From now on $G$ is always a \emph{finite group} and $V$ a finite-dimensional vector space over the complex number. Most results will hold over any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.

\subsection{Motivating example}

In 1896 Dedekind made the following observation. Let $\C[x_g \mid g \in G]$ be the free $\C$-algebra with basis the elements of $G$. Then one can form the following polynomial:
\[
P_G(x_{\rho_1},\ldots,x_{\rho_n}) = \det \left( (x_{\rho_i g_j})_{i,j=1}^n \right).
\]

Note that the matrix is just the multiplication table for the group $G$. The problem is to decompose $P_G$ into irreducible polynomials. 

\begin{example}
Let $G=S_3$. Then $G$ is generated by two elements $r$ and $s$ with the relation $srs=r^2$. If we write the elements of $G$ as $\{e,r,r^2,s,sr,sr^2\}$, then the multiplication table looks like
 $$ \bgroup\begin{pmatrix}
e&     r&     r^2&     s&     sr&     sr^2\\
     r&    r^2&     e&    sr^2&     s&     sr\\ 
    r^2&     e&     r&     sr&     sr^2&     s\\ 
    s&     sr&    sr^2&     e&     r&    r^2\\ 
    sr&     sr^2&     s&    r^2&    e&     r\\
  sr^2&     s&   sr&     r&    r^2&     e\\
     \end{pmatrix}\egroup.$$
The determinant is quite long, so I won't write it out. Suffice it to say it is a degree $6$ polynomial with 146 terms. Using a computer algebra system such as \verb|Macaulay2|, one can decompose it. It decomposes into three factors: one quadratic and two linear. They are the following (we change notation to avoid confusion about exponents):
\[
x_e+x_r+x_{r^2}+x_s+x_{sr}+x_{sr^2}
\]
and 
\[
x_e+x_r+x_{r^2}-x_s-x_{sr}-x_{sr^2}
\]
and 
\[
x_e^2-x_ex_r+x_{r^2}-x_e x_{r^2}-x_r x_{r^2} + x_{r^2}^2-x_s^2+x_s x_{sr} - x_{sr^2}^2 + x_s x_{sr^2}-x_{sr^2}^2-x_{sr^2}^2.
\]
We will see later that the first factor corresponds to the trivial representation, the second to the alternating representation, and the third is the so-called standard represenation of $G$.
\end{example}
Frobenius proved the following theorem:
\begin{thm}
  Let $P_G= \prod_{i=1}^r P_i^{m_i}$ be the decomposition of $P_G$ into irreducibles. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $m_i=\deg P_i$ for every $i$.
\item $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes in $G$. 
  \end{enumerate}
In particular, since $r=\lvert G \rvert $ if and only if $G$ is abelian, $P_G$ decomposes into linear factors if and only if $G$ is abelian.
\end{thm}

In trying to prove the above theorem, Frobenius had to develop representation theory.

\subsection{Representations}

A \textbf{representation of $G$ on $V$} is a homomorphism $\pi:G \to \GL(V)$. We will denote a representation interchangably by $\pi, (\pi,V), V_\pi$ or $V$, depending upon the situation.

This means that a representation is a \emph{linear} action of $G$ on $V$.

\begin{example}
  The trivial representation $\epsilon$ of any group is given by letting $V= \C$ and $\epsilon(g)=e$ for all $g \in G$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Left regular representation]
Let $\C[G]$ be the space of functions on $G$. It is a finite-dimensional vector space under pointwise addition. Define $\lambda:G \to \GL(\C[G])$ by
\[
g \mapsto \left(f \mapsto (h \mapsto f(g^{-1}h)) \right)
\]
This vector space have a basis consisting of the characteristic functions $e_g$ for $g \in G$. On these elements on sees that the action is given by $g \cdot e_h = e_{gh}$. 

\end{example}
\begin{example}
 Similarly, one has the \textbf{permutation representation}. Let $X$ be a $G$-set, i.e. a set on which $G$ acts. Then one forms the space $\C[X]$ of $X$-valued functions. It has a basis $e_x$ of characteristic functions, and the action of $G$ on $\C[X]$ is given by $g e_x = e_{gx}$. 
\end{example}

The notion of isomorphism is not surprising. An \textbf{equivalence} of representations $(\pi,V)$ and $(\theta,W)$ is given by a vector space isomorphism $T:V \to W$ such that $T(g \cdot v) = g \cdot T(v)$ for all $g \in G$.

In case $T:V \to W$ is not an isomorphism, we say that $T$ is an \textbf{intertwiner} of $V$ and $W$. The set of intertwiners is denoted by $\Mor(\pi,\theta)$ or $\Hom_G(V,W)$.

A subspace $W \subset V$ is \textbf{invariant} if $g \cdot W \subset W$ for all $g \in G$. Letting $\theta(g) = \restr{\pi(g)}{W}$, we get another representation of $G$, called a \textbf{subrepresentation} of $G$. We write $\restr{\pi}{W}$ for $\theta$. 

If we have two representation $(\pi,V)$ and $(\pi',V')$, we can form the \textbf{direct sum representation} by letting $g \in G$ act on $V \oplus V'$ componentwise. Note that $\pi$ is a subrepresentation of $V \oplus V'$.

\begin{prop}[Mascke's theorem]
\label{propmaschke}
Let $(\pi,V)$ be a representation of $G$ and $W \subset V$ an invariant subspace. Then there exists a complementary invariant subspace $W^\perp$. That is, $W$ is also invariant and such that $V = W \oplus W^\perp$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  We prove this by ``averaging''. Let $P:V \to W$ be \emph{any} projection from $V$ to $W$. Then define 
\[
\Pi(v) = \frac 1{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} g P(g^{-1}v).
\]
This is a $G$-linear morphism, because
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pi(h\cdot v) &= \frac 1{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} g P(g^{-1} h \cdot v) \\  
&=  \frac 1{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} g P((h^{-1}g) \cdot v) \\
&=  \frac h{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} h^{-1}g P((h^{-1}g) \cdot v).
\end{eqnarray*}
It is also surjective, since if $v \in W$, then clearly $\Pi(v)=v$. Hence $\Pi$ is a $G$-linear surjection onto $W$. Then it is clear that $\ker \Pi$ is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$ complementary to $W$.
\end{proof}

We say that a representation is \textbf{irreducible} if it has no proper invariant subspaces. A representation is \textbf{completely reducible} if it decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible representations.

\begin{example}
  Let $G = (\R,+)$ act on $\R^2$ by the matrices
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & a \\ 
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This leaves the $x$-axis fixed, so the representation is not irreducible. But it does not split into irreducible representations, since there is no complementary subspaces.
\end{example}

However, if $G$ is finite (or \textbf{compact}, as we shall see later), things are nicer:

\begin{thm}
 Any finitely-dimensional representation of a finite group $G$ is completely reducible.
\end{thm}
The proof follows directly from Maschke's theorem \eqref{propmaschke}.  

We next prove Schur's lemma, which although has a very simple proof, has great consequences.

\begin{prop}[Schur's lemma]
Let $(V,\pi)$ and $(W,\theta)$ be irreducible representations. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\pi \not \sim \theta$, then $\Hom_G(V,W)=0$.
\item If $\pi \sim \theta$, then $\Hom_G(V,W)$ is $1$-dimensional. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Both the kernel and the image of a morphism of representations is a representation. But since $V,W$ are irreducible, it follows that $\ker \varphi = 0$ or $\ker \varphi  = V$ for any $\varphi:V \to W$. This proves i). 

Now suppose $\Pi:V \to W$ is an equivalence of representations. Let $\varphi \in \Hom_G(V,W)$. Then $\varphi$ must be an equivalence as well, since the neither the kernel nor image can be non-zero. Consider $T=\varphi^{-1} \circ \Pi: V \to V$. This is a linear map, and since we work over $\C$, it has an eigenvalue $\lambda$. Now consider $T-\lambda \id_V$. This has non-zero invariant kernel, hence $T-\lambda \id_V=0$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 If $G$ is abelian, then any irreducible representation of $G$ is 1-dimensional.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Each $g \in G$ gives a map $\pi(g):V \to V \in \End(V)$. This is even an intertwining map, because $\pi(g)\pi(h)=\pi(gh)=\pi(hg)=\pi(h)\pi(g)$.

If $\pi$ is not trivial, by Schur's lemma, this map is just multiplication by some constant. But any 1-dimensional subspace of $V$ is invariant under this action, so $V$ must be 1-dimensional in order to be irreducible.
\end{proof}

Thus, up to equivalence, every irreducible representation of a finite abelian group is just a homomorphism $\chi:G \to \C$. But since $G$ is finite, this actually maps into $\mathbb T := \{ z \in \C \mid \lvert z \rvert = 1 \}$. Such maps are called \textbf{characters} of $G$. Denote by $\hat G$ the \emph{set} of irreducible representations of $G$. 

We call the $\hat G$ the \textbf{Pontryagin dual} of $G$. It is an abelian group under pointwise multiplication. See Exercise 2 for more on this.

\begin{remark}
  If $G$ is non-abelian, there will always exist irreducible representations of dimension $\geq 2$. This follows because the regular representation $G \to \GL \left( \C[G] \right)$ is injective.
\end{remark}

\section{Lecture 2 - Density theorems}

\subsection{Density theorems}

Let $(V,\pi)$ be an irreducible representation. The set of operators $\pi(g)$ for $g \in G$ is quite large. By definition, if $x \neq 0$, then
$$
V = \mathrm{Span} \{ \pi(g)x \mid g \in G \}.
$$
By Schur's lemma, we also know that 

$$
\End(\pi) = \{ T \in \End(V) \mid T\pi(g) = \pi(g) T \, \forall \, g \in G \} = \C \cdot \id_V.
$$

\begin{thm}
 Assume $\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n$ are pairwise inequivalent irreducible representations, with $V_i = V_{\pi_i}$. Consider the direct sum representation $V_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus V_n$.

Then
\[ 
\Span {\pi(G)} = \End(V_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus \End(V_2).
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}[Proof/exercise:]
We deduce the first theorem from the second: First break $(V,\pi)$ into irreducible representations $V_i$. Then it follows directly from Schur's lemma that $\pi(G)' = \C \id_{V_1} \oplus \ldots \oplus \C \id_{V_n}$. 

Now, the elements of $\C \id_{V_1} \oplus \ldots \oplus \C \id_{V_2}$ are block diagonal matrices. It is an easy exercise with matrices to see that the commutator of this set is just
$$
\End(V_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus \End(V_2).
$$
\end{proof}

First we need some notation. Let $V$ be some vector space and $X \subset \End(V)$ a subset of the endomorphisms of $V$. Let 
\[
X' \stackrel{\Delta}{=}  \{ T \in \End(V) \mid TS = ST \text{ for all } S \in X \}.
\]
We call $X'$ the \textbf{commutant} of $X$. Thus if $(V,\pi)$ is a representation, then by definition:
\[
\End(\pi) = \pi(G)'.
\]

\begin{thm}
\label{thmdensity}
 For any finite-dimensional representation $(V,\pi)$ we have 
\[
\pi(G)'' = \Span{\pi(G)}.
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $T \in \pi(G)''$. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a basis of $V$. Consider the representation $\theta = \pi \oplus \ldots \oplus \pi$ (n times) on $W = \oplus_{i=1}^n V$. Consider $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in W$ and the operator $S = T \oplus \ldots \oplus T$ on $W$. 

It is an exercise to show that $S \in \Theta(G)''$.

Now $\Span{\theta (G) x }$ is an invariant subspace of $W$. Then there exists an invariant complementary subspace. Let $P:W \to \Span{\theta(G)x}$ be the projection with kernel that invariant subspace, so that $P \in \Theta(G)'$ (that is, $P$ is a $G$-morphism). Then
$$
PSx = SPx = Sx
$$
since $P x \in \Span{\theta(G)x}$. Hence $Sx \in \Span { \theta(G)x }$ as well. This means that there exist $\alpha_g \in \C$ such that
$$
Sx = \sum_g \alpha_g \theta(g)x
$$
This is the same as saying that
$$
Tx_i = \sum_g \alpha_g \pi(g)x_i,
$$
hence $T = \sum \alpha \pi(g)$ .
\end{proof}


\subsection{Orthogonality relations}

Let $(V,\pi)$ be a representation and let $\rho \in V^\ast = \Hom(V,\C)$. The functions $\alpha_{\rho,x}^\pi$ on $G$ defined by $\alpha_{\rho,x}^\pi(g)=\rho(\pi(g)x)$ is called a \textbf{matrix coefficient} of $\pi$. If we fix a basis $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ of $V$ and consider the dual basis $e_1^\ast,\ldots, e_n^\ast$ of $V^\ast$, then we write $\alpha_{ij}^\pi$ instead of $\alpha_{e_i^\ast,e_j}^\pi$.

In the basis $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ we have
$$
\pi(g) = \left( \alpha_{ij}^\pi(g) \right)_{ij}
$$

\begin{thm}
 We have:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item If $\pi$ and $\theta$ are inequivalent irreducible representations, then
\[
\frac 1{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_g \alpha_{f,x}^\pi(g) \alpha_{\rho,y}^\theta(g^{-1}) = 0
\]
for all $f \in V_\pi^\ast$, $\rho \in V_\theta^\ast$, $x \in V_\pi$ and $y \in V_\theta$.
\item If $\pi$ is irreducible, then
\[
\frac{1}{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_g \alpha_{f,x}^\pi(g) \alpha_{\rho,y}^\pi (g^{-1}) = \frac{f(x) \rho(y)}{\dim \pi}.
\]
 \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
It is the avering trick again. First observe that if $T:V_\theta \to V_\pi$ is any linear operator, then 
\[
\frac{1}{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} \pi(g) T \theta(g^{-1}) 
\]
is in $\Hom_G(\theta,\pi)$. 

First assume $\pi \not \sim \theta$. Then any $T$ as above is zero by Schur. Define $T$ by $T(v) = \rho(v)x$. Then
$$
0 = f(Sy) = \frac{1}{\lvert G \rvert} \sum_{g \in G} \alpha_{f,x}^\pi(g) \alpha_{\rho,y}^\theta(g^{-1}).
$$

Now consider the case $\theta=\pi$. Then the $T$ above is in $\End(\pi) = \C$. 

We use this proof to introduce some new notation and concepts. If $f_1,f_2 \in \C[G]$, we define their \textbf{convolution product} by the following formula
\[
(f_1 \ast f_2)(g) = \sum_h f_1(h)f_2(h^{-1}g).
\]
We have $f_{g_1}$.................. [resten kommer]
\end{proof}

\section{Lecture 3}
Where does the name ``orthogonality relations'' come from? 


\appendix
\section{Exercises}

\subsection{Lecture 1}
\begin{exc}
Suppose $V_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus V_r \sim W_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus W_s$ as representations and that the $V_i,W_i$ are irreducible. Show that $n=m$ and there exists $\rho \in S_r$ such that $V_i \sim W_{\rho(i)}$ for all $i$.
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
First note a lemma: If $V \oplus W \sim V' \oplus W'$ and $V \sim V'$, then $W \sim W'$. This follows from the five-lemma.

Now consider the composition $V_1 \hookrightarrow V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_r  \to W_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus W_s \to W_i$. This has to be non-zero for at least one $i$. Hence $V_1 \sim W_i$ for some $i$. By rearring, we are in the situation of the lemma above. Hence, inductively, if $r \leq s$, we find $0 \sim W_{r+1} \oplus \cdots \oplus W_s$, which is impossible. Similarly for $s \leq r$. Hence $r=s$ and we conclude.
\end{sol}

\begin{exc}
 Let $\hat G$ denote the Pontryagin dual of $G$. Then, for any finite abelian group $G$, we have $G \simeq \hat G$.
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
We first do this when $G= \Z/n$ for some $n \geq 0$. Let $\varphi:\Z/n \to \C^\ast$ be a character. Then $\phi(1)=z$ for some $z$, but $\phi(n)=\phi(0)=z^n=1$, so $z$ must be a $n$'th root of unity.

Realize $\Z/n$ as the $n$th roots of unity. Then we can define a homomorphism $\widehat {\Z/n} \to \Z/n$ by $\varphi \mapsto \varphi(1)$. Similarly, we can define an inverse map by sending $e^{2\pi i/n}$  to the character $m \mapsto e^{2\pi i m /n}$. These are inverses.

Now, every finite abelian group is a product of these groups. So it remains to show (by induction) that if $G,H$ are two finite abelian groups, then $\widehat {G \times H} \simeq \widehat G \times \widehat H$. The inclusion maps $G \to G \times H$ and $H \to G \times H$ induces a map $\widehat G \times \widehat H \to \widehat{G \times H}$ by $(\varphi_1, \varphi_2) \mapsto ((g,h) \mapsto \varphi_1(g)\varphi_2(h))$.

It is easy to see that this map is injective. To see that it is surjective, let $\varphi:G \times H \to \C$ be a character. Write $\varphi$ as $gh \mapsto \varphi(gh)$. Then we can define characters on $G,H$ by $g \mapsto \varphi(g \cdot 1)$ which maps to $\varphi$. Ok.
\end{sol}

\begin{exc}
Show that the $S$ defined in the proof of Theorem \eqref{thmdensity} lies in $\Theta(G)''$.
\end{exc}
\begin{sol}
 This is, I think, definition-hunting. DETAILS COME LATER
\end{sol}
