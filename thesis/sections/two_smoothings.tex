\label{sec:twosmoothings}

Denote by $\dP6$ the blow-up of $\P^2$ in three generic points.  These points can be chosen to be the coordinate points $(1:0:0),(0:1:0)$ and $(0:0:1)$. The torus action on $\P^2$ extends to an action on $\dP6$, so it is a toric variety.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduce $\dP6$
	\item Talk about 9-16-resolutions
	\item Its two smoothings
	\item They are topologically different
	\item Their cohomology groups
\end{enumerate}
