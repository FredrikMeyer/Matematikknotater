I have not been able to compute the Hodge nubmers of $X_1$. However, counting parameters, we can give a conjectural size of $H^1(X,\mathcal T_{X_1})$, which is the space of complex structures on $X_1$:

$X_1$ lies in a family parametrized by planes containing twelve $3 \times 3$ block matrices (spanning the $\P^{11}$), giving $12 \cdot 18=216$ parameters. Conjugation by invertible $3 \times 3$ block matrices produce isomorphic varieties, reducing the amount of parameters by $3^2 + 3^2=18$. Furthermore, rotation in $\P^{11}$ reduces the dimension by $H^0(\P^{11},\mathcal T)=12^2-1=143$. In total, we have $216-18-143=55$ complex parameters. Since the Euler characteristic is $-72$, heuristically, the Hodge numbers should be $(19,55)$.

\subsection{The three-tensor construction}

Now let $F$ be a $2$-dimensional vector space with basis $\{f_1,f_2\}$. Then we can form the vector space $V = ((F \otimes F \otimes F)^{\oplus 2})$. Let $\P^{15}=\P(V)$.

The elements of $\P$ are pairs $(A,B)$ of $2 \times 2 \times 2$-tensors, not both zero. 

Let $N$ be the closure of set of pairs $(A,B)$ where both $A$ and $B$ have tensor rank $1$\footnote{An element of $F^\otimes 3$ have rank $1$ if it is a pure tensor. It has rank $k$ if it can be written as a sum of $k$ pure tensors.}. A pure $2 \times 2 \times 2$-tensor can be visualized as a box in $\Z^3$ of unit volume. Let the variables on $\P^{15}$ be $a_{ijk}$ and $b_{ijk}$ for $i,j,k=0,1$. See the diagram in \vref{fig:222tensor}.

\caption{A $2 \times 2 \times 2$-tensor.}
\label{fig:222tensor}
\end{figure}

The equations of the set of rank $1$ tensors are obtained as the ``minors'' along the $6$ sides together with the minors along with the $3$ long diagonals, giving a total of $9$ binomial equations. 

Note that $N$ is the projective join of two copies of $\P^1 \times \P^1 \times \P^1$. As above, it follows that $N$ is a singular Fano variety with anticanonical sheaf equal to $\OO_N(4)$. 

The singular locus of $N$ consists of the pairs $(A,0)$ and $(0,B)$ where both $A,B$ have rank $1$. Hence the singular locus is of dimension $3$.

Intersecting $N$ with a codimension $4$-hyperplane gives a smooth variety $X_2$. It is Calabi-Yau and has topological Euler characteristic $-48$.

\begin{proposition}
The topological Euler characteristic of $X_2$ is $-48$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to the proof of \cref{prop:x1euler}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Using the same heuristic as with $X_1$, we conjecture the Hodge numbers to be $(h^{11},h^{12})=(9,33)$. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{The mixed smoothing}

In the above cases, we formed the join of equal varieties. In the above notation, let $V=(E \otimes E) \oplus (F \otimes F \otimes F)$. Then let $\P^{16}=\P(V)$.

Now let $W$ be the set of ``mixed'' rank $1$ tensors. In a way similar to above, we find that $W$ is a singular Fano toric variety of dimension $8$. The singular locus is of dimension $4$, so a $5$-fold complete intersection is again a smooth Calabi-Yau variety $X_3$.

\begin{proposition}
The Euler characteristic of $X_3$ is $-60$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The proof is identical to the proofs above.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The heuristic above gives $(h^{11},h^{12})=(18,48)$. 
\end{remark}

\section{Degeneration of the toric join}

The coordinate ring of the toric variety $Y$ can be described as $R = S \otimes_k S$, where $S$ is the coordinate ring of the del Pezzo surface of degree $6$ in its anticanonical embedding. $S$ has a special element $y_0$ corresponding to the origin of the defining polytope. Concretely, $R$ can be described as follows: it is a quotient of the polynomial ring $\C[x_1,\ldots,x_6,y_0,z_1,\ldots,z_6,y_1]$. We then mod out by the ideal $I_1 + I_2$, where $I_i$ ($i=1,2$) is the ideal of the del Pezzo surface in the variables ($x_i,y_0$ and $z_i,y_1$, respectively). Then $Y=\Proj(\C[x_1,\ldots,x_6,y_0,z_1,\ldots,z_6,y_1]/(I_1+I_2)$.

Consider the hypersurface $Y'$ in $Y$ given by $y_0=y_1$. Then $Y'$ is a $4$-dimensional toric variety. It is the toric variety associated to the polytope $\Delta$ with vertices the columns of the matrix

A computation shows that $Y'$ has $1$-dimensional singularities, and the singular locus is a graph of $\P^1$'s: take two hexagons, and join each vertex of one of them with all vertices of the other one. This makes in total $48$ $\P^1$'s. \todo{illustration graph}

The variety $Y'$ is a Fano toric variety, and as such, it has a anticanonical section $X_{00}$ which is a singular Calabi--Yau variety. A local computation shows that $X_{00}$ has $12$ singularities that are locally isomorphic to $C(\dP6)$, and $36$ double points.

Since $Y'$ is a four-fold, it follows that $X_{00}$ has a maximal projective crepant resolution of singularities (a \emph{MPCP-desingularization}) (see for example the comment on page 55 in \cite{mirrorsymmetry}), which we denote by $\widetilde{X_{00}}$.

A computation using PALP \cite{palp} shows that $\widetilde{X_{00}}$ has Hodge numbers $(44,8)$ and Euler-characteristic $72$. 

\begin{remark}
The variety $X_{00}$ has also been described elsewhere. The polar polytope $\Delta^{\circ}$ is equal to the product of two hexagons, and it follows that $\P_{\Delta^\circ}$ is equal to the product of two del Pezzo surfaces. An anticanonical hypersurface in $\dP6 \times \dP6$ has Euler characteristic $-72$ (see Theorem 3.1 in \cite{bestiary_hubsch}).

In the article \cite{braun_smallhodgenumbers}, Braun et al. study this hypersurface and a group action on it. They also describe a resolution of singularities of $X_{00}$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
There is a heuristic surgical reason for the Euler characteristic being $+72$. Our $X_{00}$ deforms to $X_1$, which has Euler characteristic $-72$. This is obtained by smoothing $36$ double points and $12$ cones over del Pezzo surfaces. By the inclusion-exclusion principle, it follows that a resolution of the singularities of $X_{00}$ have Euler characteristic $\chi(X_1)+2\cdot 36 + 6 \cdot 12=72$.

\section{Invariant \CY's}

One way to produce mirror candidates of \CY manifolds is the following procedure: put $X$ in a family, and consider a subfamily with an action of a finite group $G$. The generic member $X_t$ of this subfamily often has singularities. Then one forms the quotient and try to resolve the singularities, hoping to preserve the \CY propert. The mirror candidate is then $Y \stackrel{\Delta}{=}  \widetilde{X_t/G}$. This is the approach taken by Rødland in his thesis \cite{rodland_pfaffian}.

In this section, I will explain natural group actions on the $X_i$´s constructed above.

Denote by $D_6$ the dihedral group of order $12$, the symmetries of a hexagon. It is generated by a rotation $\rho$ of order $6$, together with a reflection $\sigma$, subject to $\sigma \rho \sigma = \rho^{-1}$. There is an isomorphism $D_6 \simeq S_3 \times \Z_2$: $S_3$ is identified with $\langle \rho^2, \sigma \rangle$ and $\Z_2$ is identied with $\rho^3$.

\begin{lemma}
There are $D_6$-actions on both $M$ and $N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Recall that $M$ is the join of two copies of $\P^2 \times \P^2$ embedded in $\P^8$. We can think of $M$ as block matrices of rank $1+1$ in $\P(E \otimes E \oplus E \otimes E)$, where $E$ is a $3$-dimensional vector space. Choosing a basis $\{e_1,e_2,e_3\}$ for $E$, we have a natural $S_3$ action on $E$ given by $e_i \mapsto e_{\sigma(i)}$. This action extends to $E \otimes E$ by $v \oplus w \mapsto g \cdot v \oplus g \cdot w$.  

Switching the direct summands of ${\left(E \otimes E\right)}^{\oplus 2}$, gives us a $\Z_2$-action. In total we now have a $S_3 \times \Z_2$-action, which by the above remark is a $D_6$-action. Note that since the action was defined on $E$, rank is preserved, so that we indeed have an action on $M$.

Similarly, $N$ is the rank $1+1$ tensors in ${\left(E \otimes E \otimes E \right)}^{\oplus 2}$, where now $E$ is a $2$-dimensional vector space. 
\end{proof}

\todo{Torus actions}

By choosing invariant hyperplanes, the group actions on the ambient spaces descend to the \CY's. We first consider the case when the ambient space was the join of two copies of $\P^2 \times \P^2$, which was denoted by $M$ above.

Denote a unit matrix in the first factor of $(E \otimes E) \oplus (E \otimes E)$ by $e_{ij}^0$, and denote a unit matrix in the second factor by $e_{ij}^1$, where $0,1$ are taken modulo $2$. 

In this case, one such invariant hyperplane is given by the span of
$$
f_{ij}^\alpha = e_{ij}^\alpha + t e_{-i-j,-i-j}^{\alpha+1} \in E\otimes E \oplus E \otimes E,
$$
where $i \neq j \in \Z_3$ and $\alpha \in \Z_2$. Denote the intersection between $M$ and $H$ by $X_{H_t}$. Then the following is true:

\begin{proposition}
Both the finite group $D_6$ and the group $\Z_3$ act on $X_{H_t}$. The symmetric variety $X_{H_t}$ have $24$ isolated singularities for $t \neq 0,1$, and they come in two orbits under the $D_6$-action.

For $t=1$, it has $36$ isolated singularities.
\todo{Check \emph{which} singularities these are, also: fix points}
\end{proposition}

There is also a torus action on $E$, defined by $e_i \mapsto \omega^i e_i$, where $\omega$ is a third root of unity. This a $\Z/3$-action, which extends to an action on $ E\otimes E \oplus E \otimes E$. Let $H=\Z/3$. Then note that $X_{H_t}$ is $\Z/3$-invariant as well.
