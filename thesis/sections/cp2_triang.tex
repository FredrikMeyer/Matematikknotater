\section{The variety of lines on a cubic fourfold}

\section{A special triangulation of complex projective space}



\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Fano variety of lines $F_1(X)$ on a cubic fourfold is a hyper-Kähler. A monomial degeneration of this one would correspond to a triangulation of $\C \P ^2$.
	\item Conversely, a smoothing of a triangulation of $\C \P^2$ would give a potentially new hyper-Kähler family.
\end{enumerate}
