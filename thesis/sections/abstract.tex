After a preliminary chapter introducing concepts and definitions, we explore a connection between triangulations of $\C \P^2$ and degenerations of hyper-KÃ¤hler manifolds. Then we study the topology of the two smoothings of the affine cone over $\dP6$, and prove that they are topologically different by computing their singular cohomology groups. In the last chapter we construct new examples of smooth Calabi--Yau manifolds, and their respective mirrors.
