I am grateful to my advisor, Jan Christophersen, for the suggestion of this project, his unending enthusiasm, and his always open door. \newline

\noindent I thank my family (mamma, pappa, Therese, Lovise and Marie) for being there, for the love and support I got from them, and for reminding me that life is more than numbers. \newline

\noindent I want to thank Karoline Moe for her support when my motivation was low and her encouragement when my motivation was high. \newline

\noindent I am indebted to Martin Hels√∏ for his instant \LaTeX\, support service and his typographical advice.\newline

\noindent Finally, I'd like to thank all the frequenters of the lunch area in the 6th floor of the Mathematics building. You are great people, and you all made it easier for me to work on my PhD.
