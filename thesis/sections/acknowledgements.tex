\chapter{Acknowledgements}


I am grateful to my advisor, Jan Christophersen, for the suggestion of this project, his unending enthusiasm, and his always open door.

I thank my family (mamma, pappa, Therese, Lovise, Marie) for distracting me from mathematics, reminding me that life is larger than numbers.

I thank Karoline Moe for always asking me how things are going with me and my work. I thank Martin Hels√∏ for his instant \LaTeX\, help.

Finally, I am grateful for the fantastic milieu in the 6th floor of the Mathematics building.
