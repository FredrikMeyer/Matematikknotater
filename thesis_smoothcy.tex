\chapter{A smooth Calabi-Yau}

Consider the hexagon $E_6$. The join $E_6 \ast E_6$ is a $3$-dimensional sphere, and so a smoothing of the corresponding Stanley-Reisner scheme would correspond to a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold. In this chapter I prove that there does indeed exist a smoothing, and I describe some of its properties.

Description, singularities, etc.
